**Intro**

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Technologies**

The code is written in HTML and CSS using a [BEM methodology][bemmeth] and was made according the [SEO][seo] rules.

The project design and all needed data were provided by Figma tool. [Link to the project on Figma][figma].

**Additional Info**

Image files are compressed to use in Web.
External font files are legal and free. They are stored inside a project.

The project is far away from being finished and few improvements are planned in the near future:

- Provide a support for extra wide displays
- Make a visual transitions between different screen sizes more smoothly
